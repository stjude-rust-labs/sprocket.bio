# AWS S3

Sprocket supports transferring files to and from [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/).

## Supported AWS S3 URLs

The following cloud storage URLs for AWS S3 are supported:

* `s3` schemed URLs in the form `s3://<bucket>/<object>` (see [default region](#default-region)).
* `https` schemed URLs in the form `https://<bucket>.s3.<region>.amazonaws.com/<object>`.
* `https` schemed URLs in the form `https://<region>.s3.amazonaws.com/<bucket>/<object>`.

## Authentication

Sprocket supports authentication to AWS S3 using access keys.

Follow these instructions for [creating a new access key for a user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/latest/devguide/create.keypair.html).

### Configuration

AWS S3 authentication can be configured with the `run.storage.s3.auth`
section in `sprocket.toml`:

```toml
[run.storage.s3.auth]
access_key_id = "<access-key-id>"
secret_access_key = "<secret-access-key>"
```

Additionally, the `--aws-access-key-id` and the `--aws-secret-access-key` CLI
options to `sprocket run` or the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and
`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables can be used to override the
authentication settings from configuration.

## Default Region

For `s3` schemed URLs, the default region is `us-east-1`.

The default region can be changed via the following configuration in `sprocket.toml`:

```toml
[run.storage.s3]
region = "<region>"
```

Additionally, the `--aws-default-region` CLI option to `sprocket run` or the
`AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` environment variable can be used to override the default
region from configuration.
