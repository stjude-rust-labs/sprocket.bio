# High-Performance Computing (HPC) Backend

A task execution backend to support common High-Performance Computing (HPC)
environments is currently under development.

Expect a Sprocket that supports [LSF](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/slsfh/10.2.0?topic=overview)
and [SLURM](https://hpc-wiki.info/hpc/SLURM) with unprivileged container
runtimes to be released in the near future.
