# `sprocket check` and `sprocket lint`

The `check` and `lint` subcommands allow you to check a WDL file or set of WDL
files to ensure that (a) they are valid WDL and (b) to report any warnings about
the WDL files (described in further detail below).

With respect to checking if WDL files are well-formed, a non-zero exit code will
be emitted if invalid WDL is encountered. This means `sprocket check` or
`sprocket lint` can be integrated nicely into a continuous integration pipeline
to ensure files remain valid. The [Sprocket GitHub
action](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/sprocket-action) provides an easy
way to do that on GitHub.

With respect to emitting warnings, there are two levels of warnings in Sprocket:

* **Validation warnings**, which represent potential issues with the form of the
  underlying WDL documents, and
* **Lint warnings**, which are generally more opinionated about writing
  idiomatic WDL but are not strictly form issues.

`sprocket check` only emits validation warnings unless you provide the `-l` flag
(which enables the lint warnings).

`sprocket lint` emits both validation warnings and lint warnings — it is
essentially an alias for `sprocket check -l`.

## Help text

```
Checks a document or a directory containing documents

Usage: sprocket check [OPTIONS] [PATH or URL]...

Arguments:
  [PATH or URL]...
          A set of source documents as files, directories, or URLs

Options:
  -e, --except <RULE>
          Excepts (ignores) an analysis or lint rule.

          Repeat the flag multiple times to except multiple rules. This is additive with exceptions found in config files.

  -a, --all-lint-rules
          Enable all lint rules. This includes additional rules outside the default set.

          `--except <RULE>` and `--filter-lint-tag <TAG>` can be used in conjunction with this argument.

      --filter-lint-tag <TAG>
          Excludes a lint tag from running if it would have been included otherwise.

          Repeat the flag multiple times to filter multiple tags. This is additive with filtered tags found in config files.

          [possible values: Clarity, Completeness, Correctness, Deprecated, Documentation, Naming, Portability, Sorting, Spacing, SprocketCompatibility, Style]

      --only-lint-tag <TAG>
          Includes a lint tag for running.

          Repeat the flag multiple times to include multiple tags. `--except <RULE>` and `--filter-lint-tag <TAG>` can be used in conjunction with this argument. This is additive with tags selected via config files.

          [possible values: Clarity, Completeness, Correctness, Deprecated, Documentation, Naming, Portability, Sorting, Spacing, SprocketCompatibility, Style]

      --deny-warnings
          Causes the command to fail if warnings were reported

      --deny-notes
          Causes the command to fail if notes were reported.

          Implies `--deny-warnings`.

      --suppress-imports
          Suppress diagnostics from documents that were not explicitly provided in the sources list (i.e., were imported from a provided source).

          If the sources list contains a directory, an error will be raised.

      --show-remote-diagnostics
          Show diagnostics for remote documents.

          By default, when checking a local document remote diagnostics are suppressed. This flag will show diagnostics for remote documents. This flag has no effect when checking a remote document.

      --hide-notes
          Hide diagnostics with `note` severity

      --no-color
          Disables color output

  -m, --report-mode <MODE>
          The report mode

          Possible values:
          - full:     Prints diagnostics as multiple lines
          - one-line: Prints diagnostics as one line

  -l, --lint
          Enable lint checks in addition to validation errors

  -v, --verbose...
          Increase logging verbosity

  -q, --quiet...
          Decrease logging verbosity

  -c, --config <CONFIG>
          Path to the configuration file

  -s, --skip-config-search
          Skip searching for and loading configuration files.

          Only a configuration file specified as a command line argument will be used.

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

  -V, --version
          Print version
